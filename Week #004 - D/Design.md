# The ABCs of Software UX - D'

## The Quote This Week
> The price of entry for being a software designer, is not design school by learning to paint, draw, or sketch, it is your willingness to pick up and write code that keeps the needs of humans in mind.

### The Topic
Design has many definitions and if you put 10 designers in a room, you will probably get 11 definitions.  The definition I use, Design is how something makes you feel.  For a developer, probably not the easiest of definitions to use, but these 6 modules give you methods to assess the feelings generated and gives you tools to discuss those outcomes in a structured way.  Design has a long history and can be grouped into 4 time periods as explained below.

### The Definition  
  Design History
  Design means many different things to many different people.  From various talks attended over the years, and from other research, design can loosely be grouped into four different time periods.  
  1. The beginning of society to the 1960s  
    Craftwork ending with Widespread Mass Production  
    This time period encompasses most of human history, but in the context of Design it is signified by individual craft work at its beginning, but culminates with mass production and industrialization as still exists today.  Design during this time was generally thought of in the context of low-fidelity incremental innovation, such as a new flavor, or adding a new color to existing products.  Many people and organizations still rely on this incremental innovation to power their businesses today.  By extension many software projects still fall into this incremental and me too approach when it comes to innovation.  As this time period wraps up most items could be marketed by buying time with one of the three major networks in the United States.  The requirements and needs of society were not as complex, and often the designer could reason their way to solving design issues of the day.

  2. 1960s to 1990s  
  Mass Marketing and The Expansion of Media  
  Beginning in the 60s and continuing to today, is the use of mass media, marketing and advertising to sway consumer sentiment to the purchase or use of your product.  During this time you begin to see the sciences and academia discover the kinds of influence they can have over consumers.  You begin to see the mass market consumer brands realize that individual countries respond to colors in different ways.  You also see the identifying of certain societies as either being individualist or collectivist.  Human Economics and some of the research in this space gets widespread attention and will be awarded a Nobel Prize.  Design begins to take these factors of culture, behavioral economics, and colors to segment products for specific markets.  On the computing front, Microsoft Windows is launched, launching one of the largest revolutions in the way in which people will work, shop, live, and travel.  Even today, Windows is not individualized to a country besides simple translations into the native language.  Beginning in the early 1990s, both Apple and Microsoft hire experts around Psychology to study the interaction of their offerings in the context of humans.  Don Norman is hired at Apple, and Alan Cooper develops and sells to Microsoft what becomes Visual Basic at Microsoft.  During this time you get the words "User Experience" credited to Don Norman, and "Interaction Design" as fields of research.         

  3. 1990s to 2010  
  Personal Computers, and the Proliferation and Use of World Wide Supply Lines  
  During this period personal computers become standard for employee desks, the internet becomes ubiquitous for most of the first world, and you get the buildout and completion of worldwide supply chains.  These supply lines can bring nearly anything from anywhere to your doorstep either physically or more importantly for technology adoption, virtually.  Design and Design Thinking becomes a discipline taught in MBA programs the world over.  Mass surveillance and sentiment analysis of consumers either via direct primary research or via ethnography drives innovations at countless companies.  During this time the Designer as a power user of color, art, fonts, and layout is replaced by organizations that use Human-Centered Design and finding empathy with your end-users to create next-level experiences for consumers and fostering disruptive innovation as a practice.  Apple rises from the dead to eventually become the most valuable company, for a time, on the planet by doing Human-Centered Design.  Most importantly Apple launches the iPhone in 2007, and begins the transformation of using the Human Stylus, the finger, as the way in which most people will interact with Technology.  
  
  4.  2010 to present  
  Mass Computerization, Big Data, and Ubiquitous Computing  
  The iPhone ushers in an era of ease of use unprecedented in Design and Computing up to that point that becomes an inflection point, and begins a transformation of society that is still occurring to this day.  The app store launches in 2008, and begins consumers love affair with the next app in, when an downloaded application does not live up to the users needs.  Our smart phones become tethers to our friends, family, and work.  These devices are constantly delivering location, use, shopping and other  information as Big Data to Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others to slice and dice profiles of users.  Design ends up using this information to foster addiction, general changes in human behavior, and emotional impacts that are just now only being understood.  Leaders in Design are beginning to ask Should We, instead of Could We around new services and offerings.  The ethics of all this data, tracking, and influence peddling is being assessed and changes to how this works will be discussed and changed in the coming years by Design and Designers, by extension Software Developers.

making security usable for IT professionals.](https://research.redhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RHRQ-v2.2-digital.pdf)  
This is an amazing article that speaks to the requirements of good user experience dovetailing with security and that you can not have good security without also having good human centered design.  In other words, if your users can not make good choices in the context of security, you are dooming them to having intrinsic issues around  security in the context of your offering.
