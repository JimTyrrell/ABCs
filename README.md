# ABCs

Welcome to a passion project of mine to help software developers be better developers using the power of Design Thinking which includes a lot of science and some art to make better developers.

Right now, just Week 1 is mostly done.

Week 2-6 is inflight and I am still moving things around based on what I remember or think would work in a better place.

All weeks are the same format:
 - A fun quote
 - A topic
 - A video
 - A definition/s
 - A Activity
 - Future Reading
 
 I hope you enjoy this and I am happy to take in PRs.
 
 Thank You
 Jim Tyrrell
