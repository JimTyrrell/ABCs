### Behavioral Economics
   Behavioral Economics is the study of the things that make us human, and are inherent things, that we don't control,  that millions of years of evolution make us who we are as humans.  These are traits we are generally born with and exist in all of us.  These inherent behaviors can be used by us and others for good and bad.
