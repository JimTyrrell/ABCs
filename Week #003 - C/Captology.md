## The Topic 
### Captology
   Captology is the study of using technology and computers for behavior change.  One of the simplest change strategies is by using intermittent rewards.  Think of the hours you have spent playing Candy Crush, Farmville, Boom Beach, Doom, or hit the refresh button to read work emails, check out Face Book, or even write code.  
   **Think about that!!  
   Software creation is addicting!!**  
   
   Writing code is very addicting and is a fundamental reason a disconnect exists between us the software creator and the user.  They do not have the benefit of the developer's addiction, nor have they had the benefits of intermittent rewards during its creation, or via your life long love of software development.  
   
   While many different persuasive techniques are available, at all times we must be ethical around how they are employed.
